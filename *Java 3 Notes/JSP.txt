::::: JSP NOTES :::::

JSP Expression

<%= some java code %>
- When a java object is placed inside the tags, the rendered version is basically the "toString" method of that java object.

- types of objects to use inside the expression
    - object expressions "toString"
    - mathematical expressions
    - boolean expressions

JSP Scriptlet

<% one to multiple lines of java code %>

- code inside the <%%> is executed top down

Print on the page....
    - in order to include content on the page use: out.println(...)

Best practice
- minimize the amount of scriptlet code in a jsp
    - use separate java class, or MVC
