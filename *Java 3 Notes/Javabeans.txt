Representing Entities with Beans

We will use beans to represent the entities in our application. An entity is a singular, identifiable object within the problem space our application is operating in. Usually each entity is represented by a database table.

A JavaBean, or bean, is a Java class that

- provides a zero-argument constructor
- has getters and setters for all instance variables
- implements the Serializable or Externalizable interface1

This class does not perform any complex logic or control flow
-- it only serves as a way to group properties
